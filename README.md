Demo: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/16yPqgb1GVej8H4tHBy5FY5fgxD6vgYNy/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16yPqgb1GVej8H4tHBy5FY5fgxD6vgYNy/view?usp=sharing)

## Instructions

Recreate the different animations and transitions using SCSS. You are **NOT** allowed to modify the HTML file!

- Create `btn1` using **box-shadow**
- Create `btn2` *WITHOUT* using **box-shadow** or **filter: drop-shadow**
- On the fourth exercise with the gray square, make sure the "Hello!" has a fade effect as well
- The four shapes on the 5th exercise are: *square, circle, triangle, pentagon*. Look into the CSS property `clip-path`

**Sass command:**

```bash
sass -w ./scss/style.scss ./css/style.css
```

### Bonus Challenge

For a bonus challenge, try to recreate the demo video below. Use the `bonus.html` file provided. Just use the same `style.scss` file and similar to the 6 challenges, you are not allowed to modify the HTML.
